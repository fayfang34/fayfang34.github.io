### About Me

Welcome to my website!

I am currently a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Biostatistics at Yale University, where I have the privilege of working with Prof. [Laura Forastiere](https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/laura-forastiere/) at Yale and Prof. [Edoardo M. Airoldi](https://airoldi.github.io) at Temple University. I earned my Ph.D. in Decision Sciences from the Fuqua School of Business at Duke University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Alexandre Belloni](https://www.fuqua.duke.edu/faculty/alexandre-belloni). Prior to that, I obtained my M.A. in Statistics from Boston University, where I had the pleasure of being advised by Prof. [Daniel Sussman](https://www.bu.edu/math/profile/daniel-sussman/) and Prof. [Konstantinos Spiliopoulos](https://math.bu.edu/people/kspiliop/).

### Research Interests

My research primarily focuses on causal inference under network interference. Specifically, I am interested in:
1.	Defining meaningful and interpretable estimands for spillover effects.
2.	Developing computational and interpretable estimators for both average and conditional spillover effects in large-scale settings.
3.	Designing adaptive estimators for spillover effects that effectively balance the bias-variance tradeoff.
4.	Developing algorithms to identify optimal treatment rules under network interference.
5.	Extending spillover effect estimation by incorporating complex settings alongside network interference, such as jointly addressing biased sampling and network interference.

Beyond these core areas, I am also exploring causal discovery for extreme events. On the applied side, I am particularly interested in leveraging causal inference methods to support social scientists and medical researchers in deriving robust and trustworthy conclusions for their research problems.

Iâ€™d be delighted to connect if any of these interest you!
