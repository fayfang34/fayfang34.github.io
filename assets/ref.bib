The course was cut short by the illness that led to Feynman's death. Several of the lectures were finalized in collaboration with Feynman for an anticipated monograph based on the course. The others, while retaining Feynman's idiosyncrasies, are revised similarly to those he was able to check. His distinctive approach and manner of presentation are manifest throughout. Near the end he suggests a novel, nonperturbative formulation of quantum field theory in D dimensions. Supplementary material is provided in appendices and ancillary files, including verbatim transcriptions of three lectures and the corresponding audiotaped recordings.},

This permits an independent calculation of the slope of the curves of energy vs. position of the nuclei, and may thus increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved in the calculation of these curves. The force on a nucleus in an atomic system is shown to be just the classical electrostatic force that would be exerted on this nucleus by other nuclei and by the electrons' charge distribution. Qualitative implications of this are discussed.},

	abstract={Estimating causal effects has become an integral part of most applied fields. In this work we consider the violation of the classical no-interference assumption with units connected by a network. For tractability, we consider a known network that describes how interference may spread. Unlike previous work the radius (and intensity) of the interference experienced by a unit is unknown and can depend on different (local) sub-networks and the assigned treatments. We study estimators for the average direct treatment effect on the treated in such a setting under additive treatment effects. We establish rates of convergence and distributional results. The proposed estimators considers all possible radii for each (local) treatment assignment pattern. In contrast to previous work, we approximate the relevant network interference patterns that lead to good estimates of the interference. To handle feature engineering, a key innovation is to propose the use of synthetic treatments to decouple the dependence. We provide simulations, an empirical illustration and insights for the general study of interference.},

	abstract={The Test-Negative Design (TND), which involves recruiting care-seeking individuals who meet predefined clinical case criteria, offers valid statistical inference for Vaccine Effectiveness (VE) using data collected through passive surveillance, making it cost-efficient and timely. Infectious disease epidemiology often involves interference, where the treatment and/or outcome of one individual can affect the outcomes of others, rendering standard causal estimands ill-defined; ignoring such interference can bias VE evaluation and lead to ineffective vaccination policies. This article addresses the estimation of causal estimands for VE in the presence of partial interference using TND samples. Partial interference means that the vaccination of units within the same group/cluster may influence the outcomes of other members of the cluster. We define the population direct, spillover, total, and overall effects using the geometric risk ratio, which are identifiable under TND sampling. We investigate various stochastic policies for vaccine allocation in a counterfactual scenario, and identify policy-relevant VE causal estimands. We propose inverse-probability weighted (IPW) estimators for estimating the policy-relevant VE causal estimands with partial interference under the TND, and explore the statistical properties of these estimators.},

	abstract={We study how designing ballots with and without party designations impacts electoral outcomes when partisan voters rely on party-order cues to infer candidate affiliation in races without designations. If the party orders of candidates in races with and without party designations differ, these voters might cast their votes incorrectly. We identify a quasi-randomized natural experiment with contest-level treatment assignment pertaining to North Carolina judicial elections and use double machine learning to accurately capture the magnitude of such incorrectly cast votes. Using precinct-level election and demographic data, we estimate that 12.08% (95% confidence interval: 4.95%, 19.20%) of democratic partisan voters and 13.63% (95% confidence interval: 5.14%, 22.10%) of republican partisan voters cast their votes incorrectly due to the difference in party orders. Our results indicate that ballots mixing contests with and without party designations mislead many voters, leading to outcomes that do not reflect true voter preferences. To accurately capture voter intent, such ballot designs should be avoided.},

	abstract={
	Introduction: Following the introduction of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) as a replacement term for nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the relationship between MASLD and cannabis use has yet to be established. With the global rise in cannabis consumption, understanding its impact on MASLD is critical for clinical guidance. Our study investigated the association between cannabis use, MASLD, and clinically significant fibrosis (CSF) among U.S. adults.
	
	Methods: Data were collected from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey for the period 2017 to 2018 to conduct a cross-sectional analysis. The diagnosis of hepatic steatosis and CSF was based on median values of the controlled attenuation parameter and liver stiffness measurement, with thresholds of 285 dB/m and 8.6 kPa, respectively. Information on cannabis use was obtained through self-report questionnaires. Multinomial logistic regression models and subgroup analyses were used to investigate the association between cannabis use and MASLD with CSF.
	
	Results: Our study assessed data from 2,756 U.S. adults (51.1% female; 32.2% white; mean age 39.41 ± 11.83 years), who had complete information on liver stiffness measurements through transient elastography alongside reported cannabis use. Results indicated that cannabis use overall was not associated with liver stiffness in patients with MASLD. However, among females, cannabis use was associated with MASLD accompanied by CSF, with an adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.47 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.24–0.91). Heavy cannabis use (9 to 30 times per month) was associated with MASLD accompanied by CSF among female participants, with an adjusted OR of 0.12 (95% CI: 0.02–0.88).
	
	Conclusion: In our study, cannabis use did not show a significant association with liver stiffness in patients diagnosed with MASLD. However, heavy cannabis consumption in women was associated with MASLD accompanied by CSF. These findings suggest that the effects of cannabis on liver health may differ based on gender and frequency of cannabis use, emphasizing the need for further research in this area.},

	abstract={The graph matching problem aims to discover a latent correspondence between the vertex sets of two observed graphs. This problem has proven to be quite challenging, with few satisfying methods that are computationally tractable and widely applicable. The FAQ algorithm has proven to have good performance on benchmark problems and works with a indefinite relaxation of the problem. Due to the indefinite relaxation, FAQ is not guaranteed to find the global maximum. However, if prior information is known about the true correspondence, this can be leveraged to initialize the algorithm near the truth. We show that given certain properties of this initial matrix, with high probability the FAQ algorithm will converge in two steps to the truth under a flexible model for pairs of random graphs. Importantly, this result implies that there will be no local optima near the global optima, providing a method to assess performance.},

We illustrate in a number of case studies the effect of heterogeneity in the behavior of systemic risk in the system, i.e., the risk that several agents default simultaneously as a result of interconnections. We also investigate the effect of heterogeneity on the “flocking behavior” of different agents, i.e., when agents with different dynamics end up following very similar paths and follow closely the mean behavior of the system. Using Laplace asymptotics, we derive an asymptotic formula for the tail of the loss distribution as the number of agents grows to infinity. This characterizes the tail of the loss distribution and the effect of the heterogeneity of the network on the tail loss probability.},
